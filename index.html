        <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
        <br>
        <p>My name is <strong>Stephanie</strong>. I'm a current student at the Portland <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> campus, and I'm in the C# track working to become a junior developer. Moved to Portland, OR from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Santa_Margarita,_California">Rancho Santa Margarita, CA</a>, a suburb in Orange County.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In terms of education, I have a Bachelor's of Arts Degree in Psychology, recieved from <a href="https://www.fullerton.edu/">California State University, Fullerton</a>. You might think to yourself, if Stef has a degree, why did she decide to take up computer programming? Sadly, there are few jobs in the field of psychology for those with only a Bachelor's. It came down to personal economics. A Master's costs as much undergrad, and it would take 2 years to eventually become a therapist working under an established group! That's quite a ways in the future. Deciding to sign up for Epicodus makes a lot of sense, in terms of time, money, and passion. While I love studying psychology, I also have a love for computer science. I'm happy I came here to study at Epicodus!</p>

        <p>Let me tell you a little about myself. I have a passion for cooking, and I love to try out new recipes. Don't ask me to bake any breads, though. I'm sadly unskilled in that area. Games and gaming are another passion of mine. Video games, board games, and tabletop roleplaying games (yes, like Dungeons and Dragons) are what I gladly spend my free time playing. When the weather's good, I like to go for a hike. Enjoying and protecting the great outdoors is important to me!</p>
