        <h4><u>About Me</u></h4>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Stephanie Faber. I'm a current student at the Portland Epicodus campus, and I'm in the C# track working to become a junior developer. Moved to Portland, OR from Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, a suburb in Orange County.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Let me tell you a little about myself. I have a passion for cooking, and I love to try out new recipes. Don't ask me to bake any breads, though. I'm sadly not skilled in that area. Games and gaming are another passion of mine. Video games, board games, and tabletop roleplaying games (yes, like Dungeons and Dragons) are what I gladly spend my free time playing. When the weather's good, I like to go for a hike. Enjoying and protecting the great outdoors is important to me! I also have interests in dog training, gardening, the art of making cocktails, and woodworking.
